The process is the service. 
The process is the business. 
The process is the organization.
The process is the community.
The process is the culture.
The process is the society.
The process is the world.
The process is the universe.
The process is the multiverse.
```

Against what metrics?

### Cloud Failure

The cloud as infrastructure for digital services is not of benefit except for those running the services.  Prices continually increase for the same level of service, with no improvements delivered.  Standards are implemented and discarded at the whim of the service provider.  Privacy and Security are non-existent.
