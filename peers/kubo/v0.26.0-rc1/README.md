# kubo-v0.26.0-rc1

## Quick Start

Change any configuration in the `data/ipfs/config` directory.  It may be necessary to remove the `data/ipfs/blocks`, `data/ipfs/datastore`, and `data/ipfs/keystore` directories if you are upgrading from a previous version of Kubo or changing those configurations.

```sh
docker-compose up
```
