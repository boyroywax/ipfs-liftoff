# LibP2P

LibP2P is a modular peer-to-peer networking stack that can be used to create distributed systems.

## Why LibP2P?

LibP2P is the networking layer of [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) and [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io), and provides the peer-to-peer communications needed to build decentralized systems. 

It is a suite of protocols and libraries that provide peer-to-peer communication, content-addressing, peer discovery, NAT traversal, and more.

## IPFS and LibP2P

IPFS relies on LibP2P for all of its networking needs. LibP2P is a modular system, and IPFS uses a subset of its functionality.
